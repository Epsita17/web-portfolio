            <h2>Big Dream</h2>
            <h3>Dreaming of a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>With so much change taking place all at once, the dream to start a home-based professional business and be my own boss. It is not long before I started to learn about web programming. I was trying to learn from here and there and finally engaged with Programming Hero. They guided me so far so well that refresh and expand my limited development knowledge base. I have now confidence that I can be a web developer and start my  own dream project.

            <p>Over the years I failed to keep up to date with new standards and web design tools and I found myself falling farther and farther behind in the industry. I thought the wonderful world of web design had passed me by. It was then Programming Hero in 2020 and by their guidance able to start work for a company. I building started updating their existing one, even volunteering to manage my other’s website, I managed to keep the web design dream somewhat alive.</p>
